 On Debian GNU/Linux systems, the complete text of the GNU General
 Public License can be found in `/usr/share/common-licenses/GPL-2'.
 .
 The Transitive Grace Period Public Licence has requirements similar to the GPL
 except that it allows you to wait for up to twelve months after you redistribute
 a derived work before releasing the source code of your derived work. See the
 file COPYING.TGPPL.html for the terms of the Transitive Grace Period Public
 Licence, version 1, also included below.
 .
 This licence also comes with the added permission that you may link this
 program with the OpenSSL library and distribute executables, as long as you
 follow the requirements of this licence in regard to all of the software in
 the executable aside from OpenSSL.

License: TGPPL1+
 This Transitive Grace Period Public Licence (the "License") applies to any
 original work of authorship (the "Original Work") whose owner (the "Licensor")
 has placed the following licensing notice adjacent to the copyright notice for
 the Original Work:
 .
 Licensed under the Transitive Grace Period Public Licence version 1.0
 .
 1. Grant of Copyright License. Licensor grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
 non-exclusive, sublicensable license, for the duration of the copyright, to do
 the following:
 a. to reproduce the Original Work in copies, either alone or as part
 of a collective work;
 b. to translate, adapt, alter, transform, modify, or arrange the
 Original Work, thereby creating derivative works ("Derivative
 Works") based upon the Original Work;
 c. to distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work and
 Derivative Works to the public, with the proviso that copies of
 Original Work or Derivative Works that You distribute or
 communicate shall be licensed under this Transitive Grace Period
 Public Licence no later than 12 months after You distributed or
 communicated said copies;
 d. to perform the Original Work publicly; and
 e. to display the Original Work publicly.
 2. Grant of Patent License. Licensor grants You a worldwide,
 royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable license, under patent
 claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in the
 Original Work as furnished by the Licensor, for the duration of the
 patents, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and import the
 Original Work and Derivative Works.
 3. Grant of Source Code License. The term "Source Code" means the
 preferred form of the Original Work for making modifications to it and
 all available documentation describing how to modify the Original
 Work. Licensor agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source
 Code of the Original Work along with each copy of the Original Work
 that Licensor distributes. Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this
 obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code in an
 information repository reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and
 convenient access by You for as long as Licensor continues to
 distribute the Original Work.
 4. Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the
 names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their
 trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or promote
 products derived from this Original Work without express prior
 permission of the Licensor. Except as expressly stated herein, nothing
 in this License grants any license to Licensor's trademarks,
 copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property.
 No patent license is granted to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have
 made, or import embodiments of any patent claims other than the
 licensed claims defined in Section 2. No license is granted to the
 trademarks of Licensor even if such marks are included in the Original
 Work. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit
 Licensor from licensing under terms different from this License any
 Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.
 5. External Deployment. The term "External Deployment" means the use,
 distribution, or communication of the Original Work or Derivative
 Works in any way such that the Original Work or Derivative Works may
 be used by anyone other than You, whether those works are distributed
 or communicated to those persons or made available as an application
 intended for use over a network. As an express condition for the
 grants of license hereunder, You must treat any External Deployment by
 You of the Original Work or a Derivative Work as a distribution under
 section 1(c).
 6. Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any
 Derivative Works that You create, all copyright, patent, or trademark
 notices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any
 notices of licensing and any descriptive text identified therein as an
 "Attribution Notice." You must cause the Source Code for any
 Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent Attribution
 Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have
 modified the Original Work.
 7. Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants
 that the copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights
 granted herein by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are
 sublicensed to You under the terms of this License with the permission
 of the contributor(s) of those copyrights and patent rights. Except as
 expressly stated in the immediately preceding sentence, the Original
 Work is provided under this License on an "AS IS" BASIS and WITHOUT
 WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation,
 the warranties of non-infringement, merchantability or fitness for a
 particular purpose. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL
 WORK IS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential
 part of this License. No license to the Original Work is granted by
 this License except under this disclaimer.
 8. Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal
 theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or
 otherwise, shall the Licensor be liable to anyone for any indirect,
 special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising
 as a result of this License or the use of the Original Work including,
 without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage,
 computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial
 damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not apply to the
 extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.
 9. Acceptance and Termination. If, at any time, You expressly assented to
 this License, that assent indicates your clear and irrevocable
 acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions. If You
 distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work or a Derivative
 Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to
 obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License.
 This License conditions your rights to undertake the activities listed
 in Section 1, including your right to create Derivative Works based
 upon the Original Work, and doing so without honoring these terms and
 conditions is prohibited by copyright law and international treaty.
 Nothing in this License is intended to affect copyright exceptions and
 limitations (including 'fair use' or 'fair dealing'). This License
 shall terminate immediately and You may no longer exercise any of the
 rights granted to You by this License upon your failure to honor the
 conditions in Section 1(c).
 10. Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate
 automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted
 to You by this License as of the date You commence an action,
 including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor or any
 licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a patent. This
 termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging patent
 infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software
 or hardware.
 11. Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to
 this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction
 wherein the Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary
 business, and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its
 conflict-of-law provisions. The application of the United Nations
 Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is
 expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the scope of
 this License or after its termination shall be subject to the
 requirements and penalties of copyright or patent law in the
 appropriate jurisdiction. This section shall survive the termination
 of this License.
 12. Attorneys' Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or
 seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be
 entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including, without
 limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in
 connection with such action, including any appeal of such action. This
 section shall survive the termination of this License.
 13. Miscellaneous. If any provision of this License is held to be
 unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
 necessary to make it enforceable.
 14. Definition of "You" in This License. "You" throughout this License,
 whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity
 exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this
 License. For legal entities, "You" includes any entity that controls,
 is controlled by, or is under common control with you. For purposes of
 this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to
 cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract
 or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
 outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
 15. Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise
 restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor
 promises not to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.
 16. Modification of This License. This License is Copyright (c) 2007 Zooko
 Wilcox-O'Hearn. Permission is granted to copy, distribute, or
 communicate this License without modification. Nothing in this License
 permits You to modify this License as applied to the Original Work or
 to Derivative Works. However, You may modify the text of this License
 and copy, distribute or communicate your modified version (the
 "Modified License") and apply it to other original works of authorship
 subject to the following conditions: (i) You may not indicate in any
 way that your Modified License is the "Transitive Grace Period Public
 Licence" or "TGPPL" and you may not use those names in the name of
 your Modified License; and (ii) You must replace the notice specified
 in the first paragraph above with the notice "Licensed under " or with
 a notice of your own that is not confusingly similar to the notice in
 this License.
